    <h1>Aircraft Detection Device/Sky Spy/Sky Stalker/Avoidaplane</h1>
    <p>Due to the rise in drone usage, the possibility of collisions involving other aircraft also increases. Preventative measures can be implemented to mitigate this risk through on-board position tracking. Outfitting a drone with Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) technology contributes to situational awareness in aircraft avoidance. ADS-B is an aviation tracking technology that uses satellite positioning to transmit location and aircraft information. While many drones use cameras and vision techniques, the use of ADS-B tracking will add to drone operator&#39;s awareness of surrounding threats and reduce the risk of collision with ADS-B Out equipped aircraft. This device can be affixed to the drone and transmits ADS-B information to a ground station via radio transceivers. The ground station then performs all of the necessary calculations in order to deliver an accurate representation of surrounding air traffic. </p>
